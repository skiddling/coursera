00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:07,796
[SOUND] Hi,
I'm going to discuss the first lecture,

2
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:13,408
A Brief Introduction to Data Mining.

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:19,770
We are going to briefly, discuss this
because the concept, is well understood.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,930
And, if you want to know more, please
feel free to get into my chapter 1 of

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,910
the textbook, and you can,
you can read and get more details.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,220
The first question I'm going to
ask you is, why data mining?

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,070
You probably say,

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,650
since I'm taking the course I know,
why I'm going to do data mining.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,280
It's a very simple common sense concept.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,480
We are living in a digitized society.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,230
We are surrounded with big data,
or we say,

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,968
we are encountering the explosive
growths of the data.

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:58,730
The data ex, explosion problem has been
here, since computer comes to the stage,

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,870
especially with the web appearing with
lots of data collection tools appearing.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,060
We're collecting lots of data.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,260
First, we actually got the web and
the computer's rise to society.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,690
The news, digital media,
social networks, e-commerce, and

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,720
you know, banking, you know, every corner
of society generate huge amount of data.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,030
Even in science and engineering,
we got a remote sensing,

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,820
bioinformatics, scientific simulation and
many other domains.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,790
They keep generate
tremendous amount of data.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,000
So, people say we are drowning in data but
starving for knowledge.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Why?

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,770
Just because a lot of data we've
generated are unstructured.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,370
The knowledge is deeply, buried inside.

26
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,620
If we do not have powerful
tools to mine such data,

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,489
it is impossible we can get
lots of benefit from such data.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,020
So, data mining is a really a necessity.

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,420
So people say,
necessity is a mother of invention.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,360
Data mining is a tool to automatically,

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,430
to do scalable analysis of massive am,
amount of data.

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,980
So this is a really needed technology.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,980
So, what is data mining?

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,120
Most people based on my
understanding refer data mining,

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,100
as knowledge discovery from data.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,250
Actually, the first KDD
workshop started in 1989,

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,950
was called Knowledge Discovery
in Databases.

38
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,230
But a few years later in 1995, when the
first KDD conference come to the stage,

39
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:52,020
they changed the title of the conference
to Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,020
So, data mining really become a popular
term, you know, even at that stage.

41
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,900
Okay?

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,130
So, for data mining,
most people thinking is

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,080
extraction of interesting patterns
of knowledge from massive data.

44
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,810
What is interesting patterns?

45
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,448
Usually the pattern could be non-trivial,
implicit, previous unknown,

46
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,385
potentially useful, or
ev, even actionable.

47
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:18,885
Okay.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,640
But actually if you think.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,310
Sit back and think a little.

50
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,770
Data mining is actually, a misnomer.

51
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,620
Why?

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,500
Because we think gold mining.

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,430
The gold mining is not, we got lots of
gold, or we mine something out of gold.

54
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,700
We actually got lots of sands, or ore.

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,880
We mine you know, sand,
and ore to get gold.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,220
So to that extent,
more precisely, we should say,

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,680
we mine data,
actually we want to get knowledge.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,420
So essentially,
it is knowledge mining from data.

59
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,750
But since data mining is a short term,
people say,

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,990
we are doing the mining process.

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,890
We are dealing with data, so data
mining becomes a very popular term, so

62
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,690
people understand that we are doing
knowledge mining from data, so

63
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,080
there's no real ambiguity if we
call just it, as data mining.

64
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:18,775
But data mining, some people say, data
mining is essentially some, some other

65
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:23,415
fields, like machine learning, or pattern
recognitions, statistical database.

66
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:27,115
Actually, data mining is
a interdisciplinary field,

67
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:33,115
integrating many methods, and
develop a lot of new methods of its own.

68
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,324
So, we are going to
discuss this relationship.

69
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,010
In the next several slides.

70
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,850
Okay.

71
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,170
So let's look at this picture.

72
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,970
This picture, people call this one,
is a knowledge discovery process.

73
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,030
Essentially is we got from data,
actually data could be anywhere,

74
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,020
we drawn as a disk,
actually could be on the web,

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,030
could be a data streams,
could be fires as long, as is digitized.

76
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,890
We take the data from multiple sources.

77
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,700
We do data integration, data cleaning,

78
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,520
data normalization, or feature selection,
dimension analysis reduction.

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,300
All of these we call data integration and
data processing.

80
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,373
Okay, then we get integrated and

81
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:21,817
process data, which could be stored
in databases, data warehouses or

82
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:26,900
some or some other data repositories,
or even in the form of data streams.

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,850
Okay.

84
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,390
Then with such huge amount
of data in many cases,

85
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,090
people only interested in part of it.

86
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,510
So, we may need to do data
selection by using queries,

87
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,020
by using feature selection,
or any other methods.

88
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,620
Then, we perform data mining.

89
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,940
Data mining these functions,

90
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,950
we are going to discuss in
the next slides a little more.

91
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,820
Finally, we get patterns but
a pattern is not the final product,

92
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,370
because the pattern could be redundant,
pattern may not be quite meaningful.

93
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,620
So we still need to do pattern evaluation,

94
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,580
pattern selection, data pattern
interpretation, and data visualization.

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,840
Sometimes we found the pattern is not
what we need, that we can have a backward

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,440
process to redo the data mining, or you
calling some other data mining functions.

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,090
Finally, we develop a pattern,
we think they are valuable.

98
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,940
We present in a visual way, or

99
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,320
in a usable way that means we really
gotta patent information and knowledge.

100
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,960
Remember for these processes, we only say,

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,163
Data Mining is part of KDD process
of course, is most critical one.

102
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:40,180
Actually, data pre-processing
sometimes is also very critical,

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,430
takes a lot of efforts it will depends
on your application by the data mining.

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,400
For this course is a core
function we're going to study.

105
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,420
For Data Mining,
we can have a Multi-Dimensional View.

106
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,345
That means, data mining can be viewed
from multiple angles, for example to see,

107
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:03,560
from the data view, from knowledge view,
from methodologies view, and

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,949
from application point of view.

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,790
From data view, essentially, as we study
what kind of data we're going to mind?

110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,390
Essentially, there are two kinds.

111
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,875
One, we called structured, and

112
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,360
semi-structured data, and
other is unstructured data.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,115
The structured and semi-structured data
could come from relational databases,

114
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:25,260
object-relational databases,
data warehouses, or

115
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,670
even from transactions,
transaction databases.

116
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,320
Okay.

117
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,630
For unstructured data,
data can come from anywhere.

118
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,890
For example, from the web,
from text, news.

119
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,860
Okay.
Or from spatial,

120
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,390
spatiotemporal devices' sensors.

121
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,460
Or from cameras, like from mul,
you get multimedia data.

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,870
It could be from multiple sensors,
you get data streams, or

123
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,540
we get a biological sequences,
temporal data, time series data, and also,

124
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,900
recently, there are lots of network data.

125
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,420
For example, social networks, information
networks, web graphs, need to be mined.

126
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,140
So, essentially, since the data are of so
different kinds.

127
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,160
It creates lots of new challenges,
and problems for data mining.

128
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,430
Another view for
data mining is knowledge view.

129
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,990
Knowledge view, you essentially study,
what kind of knowledge to be mined.

130
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,020
For example, we may use different
methods to do data summary,

131
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,420
multidimensional aggregation,
const, getting data cubes.

132
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,770
Put in the data warehouse to do old lab,
online and a little bit processing.

133
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,730
This is one way to mine data.

134
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,460
Another way is we may look
at it to find patterns.

135
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,630
Like frequent patterns,
correlation, association, and

136
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,598
use such patterns in many other tasks,
or even implicitly.

137
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,265
Okay.

138
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:59,800
The third major task is classification,
and predictive modeling.

139
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,070
This many is we may get
some training data.

140
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,790
It could be labeled by experts.

141
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,740
Then we use this training
data we get models.

142
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,780
Using this model we can predict,
or label the new data.

143
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,930
Okay.
So this prediction,

144
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,740
we call this model construction and
prediction, as predictive modeling, so

145
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,190
classification and the predictive modeling
in many cases, they could be synonyms.

146
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,750
But if you got data, you do not
really have expert give you labors,

147
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,320
that means the data could be unsupervised.

148
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,330
Then this forms a cluster process.

149
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,980
Okay.

150
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,965
Clustering essentially, is trying to
group data to from different groups, or

151
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,755
different categories, or even hierarchies.

152
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,055
The online analysis is another task.

153
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:55,775
Essentially, it's to detect anomalies,
or rare events, and

154
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,955
label them outliers to pay
special attention out of it.

155
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,065
Okay.

156
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:05,295
And if you get a time evolving data,
like you get time,

157
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:08,350
as one of the dimension,
or one of the factors.

158
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,910
Okay.

159
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,190
Then we may want to find the trends,
or evolution.

160
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,190
So, trend and evolution analysis
is another data mining function.

161
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,650
And data mining as we just mentioned,
it come from many different discipline,

162
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,200
as a confluence of these disciplines,

163
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,500
it comes a new domain or
new field for data mining.

164
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,100
Of course, machine learnings statistics
pattern recognition feed data mining

165
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,670
a lot of useful,
interesting algorithms and methodologies.

166
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,130
But data mining, itself,
generates lots of new methods.

167
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,100
And new data mining hardware, and
meth, and methodologies as welle.

168
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,630
Plus visualization,
where will greatly help data mining,

169
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,530
or understand the mine patterns, or
understand the data to be mined.

170
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,170
In the meantime, Algorithms,
Database Technology, Distributed and

171
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,350
cloud computing will all play a very
important role in Data Mining development.

172
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,300
Finally, applications is
a driving force for data mining.

173
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,640
So there are very diverse applications.

174
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,785
You need to develop many, many
different kinds of Data Mining methods.

175
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,120
Finally, we look at the Application View.

176
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,620
We also know data mining has a lot
of Diverse Applications, for

177
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,720
example, mining textbooks.

178
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,590
Text data, mining the Web, doing Web
page classification, Web page ranking,

179
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,950
Weblog analysis,

180
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,430
recommendation systems to recommend a page
different Web pages or different products.

181
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,430
Okay, so
these are one kinds of Application.

182
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,530
But mining business data
like transaction data,

183
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,710
market analysis, market basket analysis,
fraud detection.

184
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,270
All of these attributes,
need lots of data mining measures.

185
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,400
Data mining actually also benefits
computer science quite a lot.

186
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,440
Data mining can help software
engineering to find bugs.

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,140
And help system engineering to
optimize their system performance.

188
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,120
Or can even you know,
help with computer vision, okay.

189
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,610
And mining biological and
medical data will be very useful.

190
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,820
For example, we get a exponential growth
of the biological data like gene,

191
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,650
protein, microarray data,
biological networks.

192
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,580
And data mining may play
a important role in it.

193
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,220
And also recently,
there are lots of social, and

194
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,620
information networks coming out.

195
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,240
Okay.

196
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,170
How to find their communities,
how to do information diffusion,

197
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,630
how to see the information
interacting within this networks,

198
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,250
is very interesting and very exciting.

199
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,070
Finally, I want to mention
invisible data mining.

200
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,750
Actually, data mining now play
a lot of important roles, but

201
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,540
you may not even know
data mining is in sight.

202
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,450
Kay?

203
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,650
For example, you do a web search.

204
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,865
'Kay.
There are Web page ranking,

205
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,980
Web page classification, web click
string analysis, or recommendations.

206
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,516
There are many, many data mining methods,
actually embedded in your clicks, okay?

207
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:28,040
To that extent, data mining can play
a very important role in our society,

208
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,095
you may not even sense it.

209
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:30,930
'Kay.

210
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,910
So to learn more about this introduction,
I recommend three books.

211
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,620
One is my own book on Concepts and
Techniques of Data Mining.

212
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,750
The second one is a recent
book published eh,

213
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,180
in Cambridge University Press by Zaki and
Meira.

214
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,595
It's a very, very nicely written book.

215
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:57,440
Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach,
and Vipin Kumar got a book,

216
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,520
they got a new edition on Introduction
to Data Mining, published in 2014.

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,737
Finally, I want to say, Charu Aggarwal eh,
and myself actually co-edited

218
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:15,210
a new book on Frequent Pattern Mining,
which is closely related to this course.

219
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,780
Because we are doing pattern
discovering data mining.

220
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,510
There are lots of known authors,

221
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,890
they contribute to different
chapters to this book.

222
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,053
Reflecting the current data of,
of our pattern mining.

223
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,433
So, you may really want to read it.

224
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:33,919
Thank you.

225
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:43,919
