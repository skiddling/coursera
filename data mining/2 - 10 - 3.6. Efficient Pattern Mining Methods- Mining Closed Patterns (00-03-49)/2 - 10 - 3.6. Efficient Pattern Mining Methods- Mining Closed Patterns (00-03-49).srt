00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,971
>> Hi, in this final session
of this lecture we're going to

3
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,680
discuss mining closed patterns.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,150
As we already know before,
closed pattern is a compact form but

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,480
it's a lot less compression
of frequent patterns.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,910
So mining this closed item sets
is very interesting and useful.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,680
And with pattern growth approach
there is one interesting method,

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,830
would be better to call it CLOSET+.

9
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,320
Let's look at this CLOSET+,
how to develop efficient,

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,200
direct mining of closed item sets.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,620
So let's look at this
transaction database,

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,580
it contains only four transactions and
these are the items in these transactions.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,562
Suppose a minimum support is two,

14
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:58,410
we would be able to get these
as frequent items sets.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,090
And based on this we can work up
the F-list, like the following, okay?

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,052
Now we look at,

17
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:10,280
you know, an interesting method of
develop called itemset merging, okay?

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,670
The philosophy can be represented
using this example, okay?

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,620
Let's look at these project database.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,671
For these project database, we will
have acf, ef, and acf based on this.

21
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:31,856
You can see this project database will get
a-c-d-e-f and acf, but the interesting

22
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:37,870
thing is acf happens in every
transaction projecting in this database.

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,700
Acf have the same support as d.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,650
In that case, we can grab acf out

25
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,360
from acfd project database,
which contains only one item, e.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,930
It is not frequent.

27
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,073
Therefore, we will be able to get acfd,
support is two, it's the final result.

28
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:01,324
This method itemset merging.

29
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:07,040
Simply said, says,
if Y appears in every occurrence of X,

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,320
then items in Y is merged with X.

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,911
Now the X is d, and the Y is acf.

32
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:20,390
Acf occurs in every occurrence of X,
which is d.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,400
Then we will merge acfd together to
form a more, you know, compressed form.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,100
That means you can mine
that all these immediately.

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, so this is more efficient.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,350
Actually there are many
tricks developed in CLOSET+.

37
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,773
For example, hybrid tree projection.

38
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:44,528
We use bottom-up physical tree-projection,
top-down pseudo tree-projection,

39
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:47,948
there's a one technical,
sub-itemset pruning,

40
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:51,730
itemset skipping,
efficient subset testing.

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,010
But I'm not going to get into the details.

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,650
For details, you can read this paper.

43
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,420
Okay.

44
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,460
So finally I'll summarize
the recommended readings.

45
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,926
These are all classical papers
you know algorithm, you know,

46
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:13,990
algorithm mining and the, you know, the
further improvement of algorithm mining.

47
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,493
Then we have vertical methods,
we have FP-growth methods and

48
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,314
we have CLOSET+ methods.

49
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:24,601
So finally there's an interesting
survey article called

50
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:29,062
Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithms
which contain many more

51
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:32,590
algorithms covered in this lecture.

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,970
If you have interest in,
go ahead and read this chapter.
