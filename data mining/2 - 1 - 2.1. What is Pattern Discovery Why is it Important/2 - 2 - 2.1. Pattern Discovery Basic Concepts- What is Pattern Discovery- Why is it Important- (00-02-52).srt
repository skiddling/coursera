00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,380
Hi.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,880
In this lecture we're going to introduce
some basic concepts of pattern discovery.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,029
We are going to discuss these
three issues in three sessions.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,240
The first session we are going to discuss,
what is pattern discovery?

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,690
Why it is important.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,970
To know why pattern
discovery is important,

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,110
we need to know what are the patterns,
okay?

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,011
Patterns actually are a set of items,
subsequences or

10
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:42,560
substructures that occur
frequently together in data sets.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,600
We call these strongly correlated.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,770
Patterns usually represent intrinsic and
important properties of data.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,150
That's why pattern discovery is a process.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,600
Try to uncover, try to mine
patterns from massive data sets.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,850
It has many interesting applications.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,970
For example, in transaction database,

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,260
you may want to find what kind of
products are often purchased together.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,760
Then you can do some targeted marketing.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,846
And for customers, you may want to study,
if a person buying an iPad,

20
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:27,391
what are likely other products he or
she is going to buy in the future?

21
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,300
Okay.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,520
And even for
software engineering you may want,

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,826
based on the code segment analysis,
try to find copy-and-paste bugs.

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,440
For text analysis,

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,630
you may want to see what are likely
the keywords were form phrases.

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,540
Finding phrases may need
pattern mining as well.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,780
So we can see pattern discovery
could be very important because it,

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,420
it is uncovered inherent
regularities in the data sets.

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,840
It forms the foundation for many things.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,050
For example, associating
correlation causality analysis,

31
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,060
mining sequential structure patterns,

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,180
pattern analysis in spatiotemporal data,
multimedia data and stream data.

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,930
Even for classification, if we use
discriminative pattern-based analysis,

34
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,550
the classification could be more accurate.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,790
And for cluster analysis,
pattern-based subspace clustering could

36
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,930
be an important direction for
cluster analysis.

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,810
So there's no wonder why we want
to study pattern discovery.
