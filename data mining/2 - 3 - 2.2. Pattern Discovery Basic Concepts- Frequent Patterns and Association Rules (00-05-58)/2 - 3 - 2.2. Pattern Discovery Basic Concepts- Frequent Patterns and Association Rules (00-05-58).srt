[SOUND].

2
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:09,470
Let's first introduce some basic concepts.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,460
Frequent patterns and associations rules.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,005
We, first look at this
simple transaction example.

5
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:22,725
There are five transactions,
10 to 50 other transaction IDs.

6
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:26,120
And these are the sets of items.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,730
They bought.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,220
For example,
transaction ID 10 contains beer, nuts, and

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,950
diaper, which form an itemset
because this is a, a set of items.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,390
And for this particular one, it is three
itemset because it contains three.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,320
Items.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,140
And for each item set,
you may have a concept of support.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,710
Support means, in these transactions data
set, how many times does beer happen?

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,740
Like in this particular case,

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,410
there are three occurrences of
beer in this transaction data.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,030
So the support can't appear as three.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,870
But you also can use relative support,

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,130
that means the fraction
of the transactions.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,190
For example,
there are a total of five transactions.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,330
Three of them contains beers, so
the relative support is 3 over 5,

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,010
or you can say 60%.

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,710
So, we may see whether in
itemset X is frequent or not.

23
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,910
If X, the support of X,
pass a minimum support threshold.

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,480
For example, if we said the minimum
support threshold is 50%.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,530
Then, we can see the frequent 1-itemset,
in this data set,

26
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,320
you will find there are 4, like,
beer, you can see there are, 3 cases,

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,030
the absolute support is 3,
the relative support is 3 over 5 is 60%.

28
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,910
Okay.

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,230
But for frequent 2-itemsets,
you may check it.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,070
There, there's only one, okay?

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,890
Because there's beer and diaper,
they happen together 3 times out of 5.

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,810
That's why we get this.

33
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,955
But none of the other, you know,
itemsets, they pass this.

34
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,390
50% threshold.

35
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,290
So there's only 1.

36
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,051
And from the frequent itemsets we
can introduce an interesting rule,

37
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:30,660
Association Rule.

38
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,770
That implies for
example X implies Y simply says,

39
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,360
if people buying X,
what is the support and

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,950
confidence people will buy the itemset Y,
okay.

41
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,250
Then s is the support which
is the probability X and

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,650
Y contain together in this rule set, okay.

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,650
Then c is the confidence which
is a conditional probability.

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,920
That means, if the transaction contains X,

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,510
what is the probability
it also contains Y?

46
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,080
So, for this probability computation,
you can use support X union Y,

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,780
divided by support X.

48
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,200
That means, take the whole rule support,
divide by the left-hand side.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,630
You may see this notion X unit Y.

50
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,580
This is a set unit.

51
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,970
But if you look at the Venn diagram.

52
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,830
Actually, connections containing
X could be this part.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,590
Connection containing diaper
not beer is this part.

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,980
Diaper is this part.

55
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,370
Containing both actually
is their intersection.

56
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,140
Okay, the intersection of the events,
okay.

57
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,800
But for from itemset point of view.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,620
Echo the transactions
containing both X and Y.

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,950
Both beer and diaper,
you will say this one work on.

60
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,985
That's why we use not X intersects Y,
but X union Y.

61
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:10,710
Okay, if you think that X is beer,
Y is diaper.

62
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,640
X intersects Y will be empty.

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,340
X union Y means it contains both.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,770
Then, for association rule mining,
is actually try to

65
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,920
find all such rules which has minimum
support and confidence threshold.

66
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,440
We already know if we set
minimum support at 0.5, we'll

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,790
find these are the frequent 1-itemsets,
these are the frequent 2-itemsets.

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,480
From here, if we set minimum confidence
as 50%, we are going to derive

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,180
two association rules, because these
two rules if you use this computation.

70
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,650
Beer and Diaper and getting together is 3.

71
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,827
In here, okay.

72
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:02,960
Then, it's 60% because 3 over 5.

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,870
And if every time beer occurs,
you can see diaper also occur,

74
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,600
that's why the confidence is 100%.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,730
But for diaper implies beer,

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,000
you probably can see the diaper
support is 4, beer support is 3.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,687
So, that means there's only 75% of

78
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:28,730
probability the customer buying a diaper,
likely to buy beer.

79
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,990
Are their more rules in this one?

80
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,780
Actually if you check this, because
this is the only frequent two item set.

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,957
These two are the only
association rules that can be

82
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,269
generated from this transaction data.

83
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:55,269
